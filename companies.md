## This List is Name of Companies i have collected through Linkedin.
       
## What to do with this list 
  1. Pick any company a day and send  as many as Linkedin connection request you can send to the employees of that company.<br>
     -- When employees will accept your request chances of getting posts of job/intern openings in your daily feed will increase.
     
  2. Message HR's to informing you in case of current/future opening (Professional message with Resume).<br>
     -- This step works in specially in case of Internal openings.
     
  3. I'll suggest targetting one/two company per week (Linkedin limits) this will take few weeks but soon you will have good connections
      and a good quality daily feed.
